# DevWorldApp
Developers connected at one website

This app is made with the MERN stack (NodeJS, ExpressJS for backend, ReactJS frontend, MongoDB for saving the users/profiles on a database)

<h1>FEATURES</h1>

- You can register/login once you're on the homepage
- Once you login, the navbar changes and you're allowed into the Dashboard
- If you're account is new, you don't have a profile and you can create one (it is saved in the database)
- You can also add Education and Experience
- Once added, everything appears on your dashboard nicely styled using CSS (Education and Experience, while the Profile can be edited via button 'Edit Profile')
- You have an option to delete your whole account.
- You have an option to view all the other profiles of the developers once you're logged in (Feature that is not yet done, and will be soon)
